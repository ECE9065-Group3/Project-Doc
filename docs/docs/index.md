# Project Requirements

## Excutive Summary
In response to the growing demand for a seamless and feature-rich online bookstore experience, our proposed website project aims to deliver a user-centric platform that seamlessly integrates user registration and authentication, a comprehensive book catalog powered by an external API, and a streamlined shopping cart with a simulated checkout process. Additionally, the project includes robust backend development with a RESTful API and a dedicated database for storing user and order data.
